                <p>Mars is considered a planet with a great potential for human colonization. Understanding the weather
                    is critical to determine what to expect and how can we make it more liveable for humans.</p>
                <p>On May 5, 2018 NASA launched the InSight Lander. It landed on November 26, 2018 and since then it has
                    been collecting weather data at the Elysium Planitia.</p>
                <p>You can find out more about the InSight Lander Mission downloading <a
                        href="https://mars.nasa.gov/system/downloadable_items/42134_InSight_Landing_Fact_Sheet_8.pdf">this
                        PDF</a>.</p>
                <p>The data below shows the latest weather information received from the InSight Lander.</p>
                <p>The atmospheric pressure in Mars is less than 1% of the pressure on Earth. So the data was formatted
                    and it shows the variation inside the 1% compared to Earth Atmospheric pressure. So when you see
                    0.7, it means 0.007atm.</p>

                <p>A total of 6 rovers were sent to Mars and while some met catastrofic circumstances, some of them

                                <p>The first attempts to send rovers to Mars were by the Russians (USSR) with a series
                                    of unmanned space probes in the 1970â€™s.</p>
                                <p>Launched in 1971, Mars 2 was composed of an orbiter and a rover.</p>
                                <p> Mars 2 Prop-M Rover, weighting 1.2kg was the first man-made object to make it to
                                    Mars but the lander entered the martian atmosphere at roughly 6.0 km/s at a steeper
                                    angle than planned. The descent system malfunctioned and
                                    the lander crashed.</p>
                                <p>The Mars 2 orbiter was successful. It entered orbit on 27 November 1971 and operated
                                    for 362 orbits. The Mars 2 orbiter sent back a large volume of data covering the
                                    period of 8 months.</p>
                                <p> The probe sent back images and data revealed mountains as high as 22 km, atomic
                                    hydrogen and oxygen in the upper atmosphere, surface temperatures ranging from -110
                                    C to +13 C, water vapor concentrations 5000 times less
                                    than in Earth's atmosphere, and grains from dust storms as high as 7 km in the
                                    atmosphere. The data enabled creation of surface relief maps, and gave information
                                    on the martian gravity and magnetic fields.</p>

                                <p>Mars 3 was a robotic space probe of the Soviet Mars program, weighting 1.2kg,
                                    launched May 28, 1971, nine days after its twin spacecraft Mars 2. The probes were
                                    identical robotic spacecraft launched by Proton-K rockets
                                    with a Blok D upper stage, each consisting of an orbiter and an attached lander.

                                <p>After the Mars 2 lander crashed on the Martian surface, the Mars 3 lander became the
                                    first spacecraft to attain a soft landing on Mars, on 2 December 1971. It failed 20

                                    Ares Vallis region, it weights 11.5kg and explored Mars for around three months.</p>
                                <p>It has front and rear cameras and hardware to conduct several scientific experiments.
                                    Designed for a mission lasting 7 sols, with possible extension to 30 sols, it was in
                                    fact active for 83 sols (85 earth days).</p>
                                <p>The base station had its last communication session with Earth on September 27, 1997.
                                    The rover needed the base station to communicate with Earth, despite still
                                    functioning at the time communications ended.</p>
                                <p>Sojourner traveled a distance of just over 100 meters (330 ft) by the time
                                    communication was lost. It was instructed to stay stationary until October 5, 1997
                                    (sol 91) and then drive around the lander.</p>
                                <p>The communication with earth was through UHF radio modems that worked similar to
                                    walkie-talkies, but sent data, not voice. It could send or receive, but not both at
                                    same time. The data was communicated in bursts of 2 kilobytes.</p>
                                <p>The rover was also equipped with an Alpha Photon X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) that could
                                    determine elemental composition of Mars rocks and dust, except for hydrogen. The
                                    rover also had three cameras: two monochrome cameras
                                    in front, and a color camera in the rear.</p>

                                <p>Opportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover â€“ B), and nicknamed "Oppy",
                                    is a robotic rover that was active on Mars from 2004 until the middle of 2018.</p>
                                <p>Launched on July 7, 2003, as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed
                                    in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin Spirit (MER-A)
                                    touched down on the other side of the planet. With
                                    a planned 90-sol duration of activity (slightly more than 90 Earth days), Spirit
                                    functioned until it got stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, while
                                    Opportunity was able to stay operational for 5111 sols
                                    after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual recharging of
                                    its batteries using solar power, and hibernating during events such as dust storms
                                    to save power.</p>
                                <p>This careful operation allowed Opportunity to exceed its operating plan by 14 years,
                                    46 days (in Earth time), 55 times its designed lifespan and traveled a distance of
                                    45.16 kilometers (28.06 miles).</p>
                                <p>Mission highlights included finding extramartian meteorites such as Heat Shield Rock
                                    (Meridiani Planum meteorite), and over two years of exploring and studying Victoria
                                    crater. The rover survived moderate dust storms and
                                    in 2011 reached Endeavour crater, which has been described as a "second landing
                                    site". The Opportunity mission is considered one of NASA's most successful ventures.
                                </p>
                                <p>Due to the planetary 2018 dust storm on Mars, Opportunity ceased communications on
                                    June 10 and entered hibernation on June 12, 2018. It was hoped it would reboot once
                                    the weather cleared but it did not, suggesting either
                                    a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust had covered its solar panels. On
                                    February 13, 2019, NASA officials declared that the Opportunity mission was
                                    complete, after the spacecraft had failed to respond to over
                                    1,000 signals sent since August 2018.</p>

                                <p>Curiosity is a car-sized (weight 899 kg, 2.9 m long by 2.7 m wide by 2.2 m in
                                    height).Curiosity rover was designed to explore the crater Gale on Mars as part of
                                    NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission (MSL).</p>
                                <p>Curiosity was launched from Cape Canaveral on November 26, 2011 and landed on Aeolis
                                    Palus inside Gale on Mars on August 6, 2012. The Bradbury Landing site was less than
                                    2.4 km from the center of the rover's touchdown target
                                    after a 560 million km journey.</p>
                                <p>The rover's goals include an investigation of the Martian climate and geology;
                                    assessment of whether the selected field site inside Gale has ever offered
                                    environmental conditions favorable for microbial life, including
                                    investigation of the role of water; and planetary habitability studies in
                                    preparation for human exploration.</p>
                                <p>In December 2012, Curiosity's two-year mission was extended indefinitely, and on
                                    August 5, 2017, NASA celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Curiosity rover
                                    landing. The rover is still operational as Curiosity has been
                                    on Mars for over 2530 sols since landing on August 6, 2012.</p>
                                <p>Curiosity's design serves as the basis for the planned Mars 2020 rover, which will
                                    carry different scientific instruments.</p>
                                <p>Curiosity is equipped with significant telecommunication redundancy by several means:
                                    an X band transmitter and receiver that can communicate directly with Earth, and a
                                    UHF Electra-Lite software-defined radio for communicating
                                    with Mars orbiters.</p>
                                <p>Communication with orbiters is the main path for data return to Earth, since the
                                    orbiters have both more power and larger antennas than the lander, allowing for
                                    faster transmission speeds.</p>
                                <p>Other equipment carried by the Curiosity rover are:</p>
