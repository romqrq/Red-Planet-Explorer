<p>NASA's Spirit rover—and it's twin Opportunity—studied the history of climate and water at sites on Mars where conditions may once have been favorable to life.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spirit uncovered strong evidence that Mars was once much wetter than it is now.</li>
    <li>Described as a "wonderful workhorse"—Spirit operated for 6 years, 2 months, and 19 days, more than 25 times its original intended lifetime.</li>
    <li>The rover traveled 4.8 miles (7.73 kilometers) across the Martian plains.</li>
    <li>On May 25, 2011, NASA ended efforts to contact the marooned rover and declared its mission complete. The rover had been silent since March 2010.</li>

Major Accomplishments
2007: Unearthed a patch of nearly pure silica, the main ingredient of window glass, while dragging its right front wheel. The silica patch, dubbed "Gertrude Weise," provided strong evidence that ancient Mars was much wetter than it is now because it was likely produced in an environment of hot springs or steam vents.

2006: Found evidence of an ancient explosion at a bright, low plateau called Home Plate. Spirit imaged coarse, bulbous grains overlaying finer material, which fits with the pattern of accumulation of material falling to the ground after a volcanic or impact explosion. These rocks, some of which had never been seen before on Mars, revealed the crater's violent history.

2006: Churned up bright Martian soil at a place named Tyrone that contained much sulfur and a trace of water. This material could be a volcanic deposit formed around ancient gas vents or could have been left behind by water that dissolved these minerals underground and evaporated when they came to the surface.

2005: Captured several movies of dust devils in motion, providing the best look of the wind effects on the Martian surface as they were happening.

2004: Discovered a surprising variety of bedrock in Columbia Hills, showing a complex geological history for the region. Some of the rocks showed evidence of alteration by water.
